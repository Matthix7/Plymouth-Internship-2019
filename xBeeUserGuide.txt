(SSH required) If you think you cannot control the sailboat from coordinator
even if the coordinator printed correct connection data, maybe the fleetSailboat
node failed to properly connect or crashed. In that case, shut down both fleetCoordinator
and fleetSailboat nodes and relaunch them. This is rare but seems more likely to happen when
the sailboat is far from the coordinator or the xBee device is close to the actuators.
You may use the TX and RX LEDs on the coordinator xBee device:
both should be blinking multiple times per second.
